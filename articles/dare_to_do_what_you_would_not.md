# Be the Yes Man


> _« Hey Vincent, That's Maria from the Couchsurfing! We're going out with friends right now. Should I come and pick you up? »_.
> _« Hey Maria. Thanks for getting in touch! I just got into the cinema. Maybe later. »_.

I'm in Sicily, in the process of practicing Italian. Watching a movie is a great way to improve a language. It's not that thrilling, no so risky, it probably comes up with some benefits and hopefully a _not so bad_ time as a bonus.

I don't know Maria's friends anyways. Nor do I know Maria at all appart from a message sent on the Couchsurfing website. I don't like to go out in dancing clubs and I'm not into drinking. What other answer could I even think of?

I can't tell you wether the movie was great or not, I ended up never watching it. Why? Because of _Yes Man_. This is another movie that I had watched a while ago. I'm not going to tell you about my filmography but _Yes Man_ was a part of my nomad change.

That Sicily night had been very unique to me with that very welcoming group of people. I could practice Italian like never before, get connections that later would become friends and get an anecdote that I would write about two years later.

I can't even think how often this kind of opportunities may have happened and that we still skip.
Stopping by a hitch hiker that will end up challenge your mindset, chatting to that neighbor in the airplane that has by some impossible chance to tell you about airboats in the Everglades which is 150km away from your next destination the week after.

Taking these opportunities is definitely not comfortable, it's challenging for sure and totally disruptive. You probably think you don't have time for that and it's at the opposite of the individual world we get more likely invited to join.

But when you have checked the box of becoming a nomad, taking the chances that are getting offered to you is probably the way that the deepest part of you is thrilling for. Stepping further on the road of the unknown. Transcending the individuality to the _indivisible-duality_ when merging into a human interaction and experiences sharing. Try it sometimes and see for yourself.
